            <p class="section-one">Autumn, season of the year between summer and winter during which temperatures gradually decrease. It is often called fall in the United States because leaves fall from the trees at that time. </p>
            <p class="section-one">Sandwiched between blazing summer and chilly winter, autumn is the "cooling off" season. Nighttime arrives earlier, temperatures begin to drop and most vegetative growth decreases. Animals begin to prepare for the dearth of food that generally comes during the winter, gathering supplies or traveling to warmer climates.</p>
            <p class="section-one">"Autumn, or fall, is rich with different festivals which mainly celebrate the return of light, harvest, and, like spring, rebirth through death," Cristina De Rossi, an anthropologist at Barnet and Southgate College in London, told Live Science. For example, the harvest festival in the United Kingdom is a time when people give thanks for the fruits of the land and collect food to donate to those in need.</p>
            <p class="section-one">The following are some events and happenings in Autumn around the world:</p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>The Jewish festival of Sukkot, which commemorates the time spent in exile by giving thanks.</li>
                     <li>On the following day, Christians, especially Catholics, celebrate All Hallows Day, or All Saints' Day, when people visit their departed and bring flower to their graves.</li>
                    <li>Halloween (All Hallows Eve) celebrations on Oct. 31 remind people of the connection with death, the spirits of those who have left this earth, and thus rebirth. </li>
                    <li>In Mexico, the living celebrate their ancestors during the Day of the Dead on Nov. 2.</li>
            </ul>

                <h1>Northern Hemisphere</h1>
                <p>Autumn is usually defined in the Northern Hemisphere as the period between the autumnal equinox (day and night equal in length), September 22 or 23, and the winter solstice (year’s shortest day), December 21 or 22;</p>
                <p>The concept of autumn in European languages is connected with the harvesting of crops; in many cultures autumn, like the other seasons, has been marked by rites and festivals revolving around the season’s importance in food production. Animals gather food in autumn in preparation for the coming winter, and those with fur often grow thicker coats. Many birds migrate toward the Equator to escape the falling temperatures. A common autumn phenomenon in the central and eastern United States and in Europe is Indian summer, a period of unseasonably warm weather that sometimes occurs in late October or November.</p>

            <div class="southern-hemisphere">
                <h1>Southern Hemisphere</h1>
                <p>In the Southern Hemisphere as the period between March 20 or 21 and June 21 or 22. The autumn temperature transition between summer heat and winter cold occurs only in middle and high latitudes; in equatorial regions, temperatures generally vary little during the year. In the polar regions autumn is very short. For physical causes of the seasons, see season.</p>
                <p>In Autumn, Australia is said to be transformed from lush green to brilliant hues of orange, red, ochre and gold as the temperatures cool in autumn. It's particularly vibrant in Victoria's High Country, the Grampians and in Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park in Tasmania. It can still be wet and stormy in the tropical north, so aim for late in the season if you’re heading up there. Australia’s major cities put on a party in autumn with many of the biggest festivals taking place at this time. </p>
